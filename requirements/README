If you update a core quartet package that is part of the requirements for
the main quartet project, you will need to update the requirements files in
this directory.  Follow the steps below.

1. update qu4rtet dependency package (make sure you have a pypi deploy step
as part of your CI)
2. tag and commit (pypi should build during tags)
3. after pypi build succeeds, run update.sh in this requirements directory
4. commit and push all changes to any requirements files in this directory
5. tag QU4RTET with a patch revision with bumpversion from the root directory
of this project.
6. push changes and tags to repository (git push && git push --tags)
